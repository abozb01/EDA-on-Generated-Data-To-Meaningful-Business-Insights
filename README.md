# Business Insights Visualizations

Welcome to the Business Insights Visualizations project! This repository contains code for generating visualizations to provide insights into weekly profits.

## Description

This project generates three types of visualizations:

1. **Predicted Profits (Box Plot):** A box plot displaying the predicted profits for the next 52 weeks using a linear regression model.

2. **Actual Profits (Scatter Plot):** A scatter plot showing the actual profits recorded for each week.

3. **Weekly Profits (Heat Map):** A heat map illustrating the weekly profits over the entire year.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided Python script (`business_insights.py`).
3. Follow the prompts to enter a file name for saving the combined plot.
4. Check your local directory for the saved combined plot image (`combined_plot.png`).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- plotly
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:
